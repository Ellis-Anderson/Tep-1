What is Shade Avoidance?
========================================================
incremental: true

- Low Red:Far-Red light is indicative of shade
- Plants respond via
  - Internode and petiole elongation
  - Increased apical dominance
  - This is theorized to affect yield

Research Question
========================================================
type: sub-section

What genes in domesticated tomato are involved in shade avoidance?

Elongated Mutant Screen

Phenotype Characteristics
========================================================
type: sub-section

Extended Petioles
========================================================
Mutant of interest (tep-1) has petioles that are longer than the control (M82) by the 5th week of development

Reduced Hypocotyl Length
========================================================
tep-1 mutant shows less hypocotyl elongation in response to shade

Sequencing and Computational Analysis
========================================================
left: 30%

- Filter low quality reads
- Map reads to reference genome
- Generate graphical output

Graphical Output to Locate Gene of Interest
=========================================================

- Take advantage of different parental backgrounds to find region of interest
- Should ideally produce one spot with 100% M82 background

Initial Results
=========================================================

My Work on tep-1
=========================================================
type: section
incremental: true

- Check over Leslie's code and reproduce her results
- Map Heinz genome to Heinz genome and add those results to the analysis
- Look for deletions from fast neutron mutagenesis in region of interest
